📚 Book Recommender – Data Science & ML Engineering Exercise

“I like Lord of the Rings – what else should I read?”

I created a book recommendation model based on user input. The training dataset, as well as the input data used to generate recommendations, come from a publicly available dataset on Kaggle:

🌟 Objectives

The goal of this project is to design and implement a recommendation algorithm that, based on user input (a book title), generates suggestions for other books the reader might enjoy.


📂 Dataset

The dataset consists of three parts:

Books – Basic information about books (title, author, publication year, ISBN)
Users – Information about users (ID, age, city)
Ratings – Ratings assigned by users to individual books
However, the data is partially limited — for example, there is no information on genres, summaries, or book reviews, which excludes the use of content-based recommendation methods.

Approach

Collaborative Filtering
Due to the limited availability of metadata, I decided to implement collaborative filtering. This approach is based on user behavior patterns — recommendations are generated by measuring the similarity between how different users rated the same books. If two users have similar preferences, the system can recommend books that one user hasn’t read yet but the other user rated highly.

Data Preparation and Filtering
The first step involved loading and cleaning the datasets. I then performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the data.

To reduce noise, I established minimum thresholds for the number of reviews per book and per user. Specifically, I set a minimum of 20 reviews for books and 30 reviews for users. These values were chosen somewhat intuitively, based on browsing book forums and shops where these averages seemed reasonable. This approach avoids excessive reduction of the original dataset, while effectively filtering out books with few reviews and less active users.

Building the Model
Next, I created a user-book matrix where rows represent users, columns represent books, and values are the user ratings. This matrix was then converted to a sparse format, which greatly improves computational efficiency.

Using cosine similarity, I calculated how similar books are to each other based on user ratings. The result is a similarity matrix that allows fast retrieval of books most similar to a given title.
