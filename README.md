📚 Book Recommender – Data Science & ML Engineering Exercise

“I like Lord of the Rings – what else should I read?”

This is a small project that shows how to build a system that recommends books to people. I'm using a public dataset from Kaggle. The project is split into two parts:

Data Scientist part – Look at the data, try out simple recommendation ideas, and see what works.

ML Engineer part – Build a basic app that gives recommendations when a user types in a book.


🌟 Objectives

Data Scientist; Goal: Explore the data, build a basic recommender, check the results, and think about how to make it better.

ML Engineer; Goal: Make a basic app using FastAPI that gives book suggestions. Also, think about how it would work if we wanted to make this into a real service.
